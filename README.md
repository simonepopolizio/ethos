# Ethos

**Exitus Acta Probat**: the outcome justifies the deed.

## Who

I'm Simone. Humanity has had what it takes to do much better for decades. The knowledge, the tools, the people. Yet the systems that actually matter stay broken while everyone optimizes their own corner. Let's fix them together.

## What I'm building

Six projects. Same root problem, different angles.

I'm looking for people who want to shape these from the ground up, not just contribute to something that already exists.

<details>
<summary><strong>EthosMesh</strong>: Decentralized territorial planning</summary>

Everyone crams into big cities because "that's where everything is." But the model is broken: rent eating half your salary, hospitals overloaded, 2-3 hours lost in transport daily, smog, stress, neighbors you don't know. And paradoxically, concentration creates FEWER job opportunities per person, not more.

Meanwhile territories empty out: schools close, hospitals close, young people leave, communities die. Enormous potential wasted.

The vicious cycle: everyone goes to cities because "everything is there" → city overloads → quality drops → but territories empty further → city remains the only option → cycle feeds itself.

EthosMesh lets communities map their own resources, assess real potential, and plan development together. The solution isn't telling people not to go to cities. It's making alternative territories ATTRACTIVE.

**The hard questions:**
- How do you measure a territory's "potential" without it becoming a gentrification tool?
- What data matters? Who owns it? How do you get it?
- How do you prevent capture by narrow local interests?

<summary><strong>EthosTask</strong>: Milestones for humanity</summary>

Crucial challenges stay unsolved because efforts are fragmented, uncoordinated, invisible. EthosTask defines concrete milestones and connects them with organizations willing to work on them.

Not PR exercises. Visible contributions. Measurable progress. Public accountability.

The deeper problem: every company reinvents the wheel, patents it, then dies and takes the patent to the grave. This happens in parallel across thousands of companies. As humanity, we don't advance TOGETHER.

Some milestones: 100% material recycling with cities as our only "mines". Climate restoration to pre-industrial levels. A third of the planet as human exclusion zone for biodiversity. A worldwide ethical operating system for AGI. These aren't science fiction. They're coordination problems. But we're too busy competing to solve them.

**The hard questions:**
- Who decides what counts as a "milestone for humanity"? With what legitimacy?
- How do you prevent it from becoming another greenwashing exercise?
- How do you incentivize collaboration over competition for visibility?

<summary><strong>EthosLens</strong>: Follow the money</summary>

Prices rise, rarely fall. Sometimes it's manipulation. Sometimes it's shrinkflation for pure profit. This traces a product's full pricing lifecycle, from origin to shelf. Expose where inflation is real and where it's extraction.

The deeper problem is dilution of responsibility: the supply chain has a thousand steps, each takes "a little." Everyone says "I'm only making a small margin." But then milk costs 2€ per liter and the farmer gets 10 cents. Where did the other 1.90€ go? Spread across a thousand "innocent" margins. No single villain. A system designed to hide responsibility.

EthosLens works through collective intelligence: the factory worker knows production costs, the supplier knows wholesale, the retailer knows margins. Everyone contributes their piece. The truth emerges from below.

**The hard questions:**
- How do you get data companies don't want public?
- How do you make it usable for average consumers without overwhelming them?
- How do you handle "everyone takes a little" when no single actor is the villain?

<summary><strong>IdeologyBase</strong>: Mapping belief systems</summary>

Polarization and ideological bubbles prevent us from solving problems together. IdeologyBase maps the full spectrum of human ideologies: political, philosophical, spiritual. Users explore, position themselves, see alignments and divergences.

Not simplistic labels. The actual multidimensional landscape of how humans believe.

The deeper problems: tribalism turns you into "one of them" before you open your mouth. Democracy has structural issues: demagogues promise everything, deliver nothing, and always get away with it. Laws hidden in 500-page packages. A politician says X, does Y, outrage for a week, everyone forgets, repeat forever. No accountability.

**Technical idea:** Political videos → Transcriptions → RAG → Vector DB → Expose "what they say vs what they do"

**The hard questions:**
- How do you map something this complex without reducing it to caricature?
- How do you prevent it from becoming another polarization tool?
- How do you make accountability stick when people are used to forgetting?

<summary><strong>EthosArk</strong>: Preserving what makes us human</summary>

When AI can do everything, we'll stop learning things. And when we stop learning, we lose more than knowledge. We lose the cognitive benefits of the PROCESS.

Math isn't useful because you need to calculate. It's useful because learning it teaches you to think a certain way. Painting isn't useful because you need pictures. It's useful because doing it unlocks something in you. The AI gives us the product but takes away the process. And the process was what made us.

EthosArk preserves cognitive domains at risk of extinction through economic obsolescence. An ark for capabilities that will disappear when they're no longer "productive."

**The hard questions:**
- Which cognitive domains are most at risk of being forgotten?
- How do you preserve processes, not just knowledge?
- How do you motivate people to learn things that aren't "useful"?

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>EthosCalendar</strong>: Rethinking time</summary>

The calendar we use was designed for purposes that no longer serve us, filled with holidays and rituals we observe without choosing them. This imagines a calendar reflecting personal and collective aspirations, rhythms and celebrations that actually mean something to the communities creating them.

The deeper question: every community has traditions from ancestors, holidays from religion, celebrations from globalization. But what do WE add? What does our generation contribute? Nothing. We're custodians of other people's culture. Invent our own rituals. Become masters of our culture, not just inheritors.

**One idea:** A recurring celebration where every 18-year-old adds something physical, like a clay sculpture where each person molds a piece on top of others. Same at 30, 40, 50. A city's living memory you can point to and say "I made this part."

**The hard questions:**
- How do you create something new while staying compatible with existing systems?
- How do you make new rituals feel meaningful rather than artificial?
- How do you get people to invest in something they didn't inherit?

## The vision

Every broken system follows the same pattern: local optimization killing the whole. Sales hits targets while the company dies. Cities grow while regions collapse. Everyone wins their game while we all lose together.

I want to build counter-infrastructure. Tools that align incentives instead of fragmenting them. Frameworks that make coordination possible. Systems designed to not leave people behind.

This isn't charity. It's engineering applied to the right problems.

## What I need

I can build all of this technically. But building alone defeats the purpose. I want people to help themselves through each other, not depend on me.

I need people who:
- See problems and want to solve them, not just discuss them
- Have skills, any skills: technical, design, research, organizing, writing, thinking
- Want to own something, not just contribute to someone else's project

I don't have all the answers. I have questions and the ability to build. If you have answers, or better questions, come talk.
