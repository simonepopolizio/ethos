# Ethos

**Exitus Acta Probat**: the outcome justifies the deed.

## Who

I'm Simone. Humanity has had what it takes to do much better for decades. The knowledge, the tools, the people. Yet the systems that actually matter stay broken while everyone optimizes their own corner. Let's fix them together.

---

## What I'm building

Six projects. Same root problem, different angles.

I'm looking for people who want to shape these from the ground up, not just contribute to something that already exists.

<details>
<summary><strong>EthosMesh</strong>: Decentralized territorial planning</summary>

Cities are choking: overcrowded, expensive, infrastructure at breaking point. Yet everyone keeps cramming in because that's where jobs and services concentrate. Meanwhile, thousands of territories sit underutilized.

EthosMesh lets communities map their own resources, assess real potential, and plan development together. Decisions from the ground up, not handed down from above.

**The hard questions:**
- How do you measure a territory's "potential" without it becoming a gentrification tool?
- What data matters? Who owns it? How do you get it?
- How do you prevent capture by narrow local interests?

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>EthosTask</strong>: Milestones for humanity</summary>

Crucial challenges stay unsolved because efforts are fragmented, uncoordinated, invisible. EthosTask defines concrete milestones and connects them with organizations willing to work on them.

Not PR exercises. Visible contributions. Measurable progress. Public accountability.

**The hard questions:**
- Who decides what counts as a "milestone for humanity"? With what legitimacy?
- How do you prevent it from becoming another greenwashing exercise?
- How do you incentivize collaboration over competition for visibility?

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Price Transparency</strong>: Follow the money</summary>

Prices rise, rarely fall. Sometimes it's manipulation. Sometimes it's shrinkflation for pure profit. This traces a product's full pricing lifecycle, from origin to shelf. Expose where inflation is real and where it's extraction.

**The hard questions:**
- How do you get data companies don't want public?
- How do you make it usable for average consumers without overwhelming them?
- How do you handle resistance from those who profit from opacity?

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>IdeologyBase</strong>: Mapping belief systems</summary>

Polarization and ideological bubbles prevent us from solving problems together. IdeologyBase maps the full spectrum of human ideologies: political, philosophical, spiritual. Users explore, position themselves, see alignments and divergences.

Not simplistic labels. The actual multidimensional landscape of how humans believe.

**Technical idea:** Political videos → Transcriptions → RAG → Vector DB → Expose "what they say vs what they do"

**The hard questions:**
- How do you map something this complex without reducing it to caricature?
- How do you prevent it from becoming another polarization tool?
- How do you handle the bias of whoever builds the map?

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Knowledge Framework</strong>: Preparing what comes next</summary>

In the AI age, knowledge shifts from possession to navigation. Knowing things matters less than finding, synthesizing, applying. The next generation needs frameworks for dynamic knowledge, not static memorization.

**The hard questions:**
- What remains essential to "know" when AI knows everything?
- How do you teach navigation instead of accumulation?
- How do you avoid creating total dependence on tools we don't control?

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>New Calendar</strong>: Rethinking time</summary>

The calendar we use was designed for purposes that no longer serve us, filled with holidays and rituals we observe without choosing them. This imagines a calendar reflecting personal and collective aspirations, rhythms and celebrations that actually mean something to the communities creating them.

**One idea:** A recurring celebration where every 18-year-old adds something physical, like a clay sculpture where each person molds a piece on top of others. Same at 30, 40, 50. A city's living memory you can point to and say "I made this part."

**The hard questions:**
- How do you create something new while staying compatible with existing systems?
- How do you avoid becoming another failed attempt to "reinvent" tradition?

## The vision

Every broken system follows the same pattern: local optimization killing the whole. Sales hits targets while the company dies. Cities grow while regions collapse. Everyone wins their game while we all lose together.

I want to build counter-infrastructure. Tools that align incentives instead of fragmenting them. Frameworks that make coordination possible. Systems designed to not leave people behind.

This isn't charity. It's engineering applied to the right problems.

---

## What I need

I can build all of this technically. But building alone defeats the purpose. I want people to help themselves through each other, not depend on me.

I need people who:
- See problems and want to solve them, not just discuss them
- Have skills, any skills: technical, design, research, organizing, writing, thinking
- Want to own something, not just contribute to someone else's project

I don't have all the answers. I have questions and the ability to build. If you have answers, or better questions, come talk.
