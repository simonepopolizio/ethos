# EthosTask

**Milestones for humanity**

## Description

A streamlined platform that defines major milestones for humanity and connects with companies or associations willing to tackle them. The system organizes work into "Milestones" (major initiatives), which break down into specific "Tasks" that organizations can claim, showcase their contributions on, and complete. It fosters cross-sector collaboration toward shared long-term goals.

## Why this exists

Many crucial societal challenges remain unaddressed because efforts are fragmented, uncoordinated, or invisible. EthosTask creates a framework where corporate resources, expertise, and innovation capabilities can be transparently directed toward collective human progress.

By making contributions visible and measurable, we incentivize meaningful action rather than superficial CSR initiatives. This system transforms how resources are allocated across sectors by aligning profit motives with genuine societal advancement and creating accountability through public tracking of commitments.

## The deeper problem

Every company reinvents the wheel. Patents it. Then dies and takes the patent to the grave.

This happens in parallel across thousands of companies. The same problems get solved over and over, in secret, in competition. Knowledge doesn't accumulate. It fragments, gets locked away, disappears.

Result: as humanity, we don't advance TOGETHER. Capitalism keeps us fragmented. Everyone protects their corner. Nobody builds on anyone else's work. We walk in place as a species.

## The milestones

The technology exists. The resources exist. The people exist. But we don't coordinate.

1. **The Great Disarmament**: Certified removal of all weapons of mass destruction. Milestone zero: without this, none of the others are safe.

2. **Post-Scarcity Energy**: Commercial nuclear fusion or global orbital solar. Energy stops being a reason for geopolitical conflict.

3. **Closed-Loop Economy**: 100% recycling of critical materials (metals, rare earths, plastics). Cities become our only "mines". Invasive extraction ends.

4. **Universal Health Shield**: Global biosecurity that detects a virus in 24 hours and produces a cure in 7 days. Eradication of malaria, HIV, and major cancers.

5. **Biosphere Stewardship**: The "30% Treaty": a third of the planet (land and oceans) as human exclusion zones. Biodiversity and ecosystem restoration.

6. **Climate Restoration**: Not just stopping pollution, but actively removing CO2 to pre-industrial levels (280ppm).

7. **Universal Dignity Threshold**: Food, clean water, housing, and digital education as birthright. Extreme poverty eliminated through global logistical efficiency.

8. **AGI Alignment**: A worldwide "Ethical Operating System" that prevents AI from becoming a weapon or acting against the biological interests of the species.

9. **Direct Planetary Governance**: Overcoming state veto power on global issues. A democratic platform where every Earth citizen has voice on common challenges.

10. **Multi-Planetary Diaspora**: First self-sufficient colony outside Earth orbit. The milestone that makes humanity "immortal" against planetary catastrophes.

These aren't science fiction. They're coordination problems. Solvable coordination problems. But we're too busy competing to solve them.

## Hard questions

- Who decides what counts as a "milestone for humanity"? With what legitimacy?
- How do you prevent it from becoming another greenwashing exercise?
- How do you incentivize collaboration over competition for visibility?
- How do you verify that claimed contributions are real?
- How do you handle milestones that conflict with powerful interests?
- How do you get competitors to actually share instead of just signal?
