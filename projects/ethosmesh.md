**Decentralized territorial planning**

## The problem

Everyone crams into big cities because "that's where everything is." But the model is broken.

**Economic:**
- Rent eating half your salary or more
- Home ownership impossible, forever
- Gentrification pushing you out of the neighborhood where you grew up
- Small businesses dying, only chains survive

**Work (the paradox):**
- Everyone goes to cities "for jobs"
- But concentration creates FEWER opportunities per person, not more
- Brutal competition for every position
- Lose your job, compete with millions of others
- Meanwhile emptied territories lose jobs → people leave → even fewer jobs → vicious cycle

**Health and services:**
- Hospitals overloaded, months of waiting
- Emergency rooms packed
- Doctors with too many patients
- Smog, pollution
- Chronic stress
- Mental health declining (isolation in the middle of crowds)

**Quality of life:**
- 2-3 hours daily lost in transport
- Apartments getting smaller and smaller
- No sense of community
- Neighbors you don't know
- Raising kids is hard (costs, space, daycares full)

**Infrastructure:**
- Public transport collapsing
- Paralyzing traffic
- Networks under constant stress

**Fragility:**
- Pandemic, disaster, crisis → millions stuck together
- No self-sufficiency
- Total dependence on long supply chains

**And the emptied territories:**
- Schools closing
- Hospitals closing
- Young people leaving
- Only elderly remain
- Enormous potential wasted
- Communities dying

**The vicious cycle:**
Everyone goes to cities because "everything is there" → city overloads → quality drops → but territories empty further → so city remains the only option → cycle feeds itself

## What EthosMesh does

EthosMesh is a decentralized planning tool that enables local communities to collaboratively map their resources, assess the real potential of their territory, and plan sustainable development.

Through structured voting and collective decision-making processes, residents coordinate the strategic use of assets, infrastructure, and land. The platform visualizes concrete community possibilities and charts action pathways based on real-time data.

The solution isn't telling people not to go to cities. It's making alternative territories ATTRACTIVE. Unlocking their potential. Creating conditions where people WANT to stay or move there.

## Why this exists

Urban and territorial development decisions are made by centralized authorities, often without genuine community involvement and with little accountability to citizens.

EthosMesh flips this model: it empowers citizens to actively participate in shaping their own environments through transparent democratic processes. By decentralizing planning, we ensure territorial evolution reflects the actual needs and aspirations of residents, not just political or commercial interests.

This approach makes development more equitable, sustainable, and distributed, creating concrete alternatives to unsustainable urban concentration.

## Hard questions

- How do you measure a territory's "potential" without it becoming a gentrification tool?
- What data matters? Who owns it? How do you get it?
- How do you prevent capture by narrow local interests?
- How do you balance local autonomy with regional/national coordination?
- What incentives bring people and businesses to underutilized territories?
- How do you bootstrap development in places that have already lost critical mass?
