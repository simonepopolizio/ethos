# EthosLens

**Follow the money**

## Description

Prices almost always rise and rarely fall. Sometimes this is due to manipulation by entities controlling prices for their own gain. In other cases, practices like shrinkflation occur purely for profit, even when companies aren't experiencing real losses. This is unacceptable.

This project proposes a community-driven system to trace the full lifecycle of a product's pricing, from origin to final sale. By exposing where inflation is introduced and how much each step adds, we empower consumers to see behind the curtain and demand accountability.

## Why this exists

Economic transparency is fundamental to fair markets and informed consumer choice. Currently, price formation remains opaque, enabling exploitation and unjustified inflation that particularly harms vulnerable populations.

By creating visibility into the entire pricing chain, showing exactly how costs accumulate from raw materials to retail, we empower consumers to identify where value is actually created versus where prices are artificially inflated. This knowledge enables more conscious consumption, rewards ethical business practices, and applies market pressure against exploitative pricing strategies.

## The deeper problem: dilution of responsibility

The supply chain has a thousand steps. Each one takes "a little":
- The producer takes a little
- The processor takes a little
- The packager takes a little
- The transporter takes a little
- The distributor takes a little
- The retailer takes a little

Everyone says "I'm only making a small margin." Nobody feels guilty.

But then: milk costs 2€ per liter. The farmer gets 10 cents.

Where did the other 1.90€ go? Spread across a thousand "small margins." Each one "innocent." The sum is extraction.

The opacity of the chain lets everyone say "it's not me." Nobody is responsible. Everyone profits. The consumer pays. The producer gets screwed. And nobody can point to the villain because there isn't ONE villain. There's a system designed to hide responsibility.

## The approach

EthosLens works through collective intelligence. People become investigators of what they already know:

- The factory worker knows production costs
- The supplier knows wholesale prices
- The logistics person knows transport costs
- The retailer knows margins
- The consumer knows what they pay

Everyone contributes their piece. The truth emerges from below, not imposed from above. No single person exposes anything dangerous alone. The puzzle assembles itself.

## Hard questions

- How do you structure contributions so the puzzle assembles itself?
- How do you verify information without exposing sources?
- How do you make it useful for consumers without overwhelming them?
- How do you handle industries with legitimate cost complexity?
- How do you build trust in crowdsourced data?
- How do you handle the "everyone takes a little" problem where no single actor is the villain?
