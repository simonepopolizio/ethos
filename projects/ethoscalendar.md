# EthosCalendar

**Rethinking time**

## Description

The calendar we follow today was designed for purposes that may no longer serve us, filled with predetermined holidays and rituals we are expected to observe. It's outdated and disconnected from our current values and pace of change.

This project aims to design a new calendar: one that reflects personal and collective aspirations, meaningful rhythms of work and rest, and events that genuinely matter to the communities creating it.

A reclaiming of free will through time.

## Why this exists

Our relationship with time profoundly impacts our well-being, creativity, and social connections. By reimagining the calendar structure while maintaining compatibility with existing systems, we can introduce celebrations and observances that reflect contemporary values and interests.

Imagine community-driven events like "Innovation Day" or "Nature Connection Day" that promote collective experiences aligned with shared aspirations. This project doesn't eliminate traditional observances but complements them with meaningful new rhythms that foster community cohesion and intentional living.

## The deeper question

Every community has its traditions. Festivals passed down from ancestors. Holidays inherited from religion. Celebrations imported from globalization.

But what do WE add? What does our generation contribute?

Nothing.

We're custodians of other people's culture. We celebrate things we didn't choose, for reasons we don't remember, following rituals that meant something to someone else.

Christmas, Easter, national holidays, imported celebrations like Halloween or Valentine's Day. Some religious, some commercial, some historical. All inherited. None invented by us.

We're not creators of culture. We're just its caretakers.

## What EthosCalendar proposes

Invent our own rituals. Become masters of our culture, not just inheritors.

Not replacing traditions. Adding to them. Creating celebrations that mean something to US. That reflect OUR values. That WE chose.

A calendar where communities decide what matters. What to celebrate. What to remember. What to build together.

## One idea

A recurring celebration where everyone turning 18 adds something physical to a collective work.

Like a clay sculpture where each person molds a piece on top of others. The same at 30, 40, 50, 60, and beyond.

The memory of a city. Something that retains its value over time. Something you can point to and say "I made this part."

Not just celebrating. BUILDING together. Belonging to something that lasts beyond you. Leaving a mark that says "I was here. I contributed. I belong."

## Hard questions

- How do you create something new while staying compatible with existing systems?
- How do you avoid becoming another failed attempt to "reinvent" tradition?
- How do you make new rituals feel meaningful rather than artificial?
- How do you balance individual expression with collective belonging?
- What physical forms can hold meaning across generations?
- How do you get people to invest in something they didn't inherit?
