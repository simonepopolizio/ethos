# 🧭 IdeologyBase

**Mapping Belief Systems**

## 🎯 Overview

IdeologyBase is an interactive visual platform that charts the full spectrum of human ideologies—political, philosophical, spiritual, and beyond. Users can explore these ideological territories, locate their personal positions, and see how they align or diverge from others.

More than static data, the platform evolves with user interaction: people can annotate, expand, or merge ideologies, creating a living intellectual map. It serves as both a reflective tool for individuals and a connective framework for communities to engage with complex worldviews in constructive and dynamic ways.

## 💡 The Problem

Political polarization and ideological bubbles threaten social cohesion and collaborative problem-solving:

- **Simplistic labels**: Complex positions reduced to left/right binary
- **Echo chambers**: Algorithms reinforce existing beliefs
- **Strawman arguments**: Misrepresentation of opposing views
- **Hidden assumptions**: Unexamined foundational beliefs
- **Tribalism**: Identity-based rather than principle-based alignment

## 🚀 The Solution

IdeologyBase promotes intellectual exploration and mutual understanding by visualizing the nuanced, multidimensional landscape of human belief systems.

## 📊 Current Status

**Stage**: 🌱 In Development

**Technical Pipeline**:
1. Political videos → Transcriptions
2. RAG Ingestion → ChromaDB
3. Data analysis: Told vs. Expected
4. Visualization and interface development

**Next Steps**:

- "Are my positions internally consistent?"

**Community**
- "What do our local representatives really believe?"
- "Where is common ground across our town?"
- "How have our collective positions evolved?"

**Educational**
- "What's the historical context of this ideology?"
- "How do different worldviews approach this problem?"
- "What are the philosophical foundations of my beliefs?"

**Research**
- "How has political rhetoric shifted over time?"
- "What predicts ideological alignment?"
- "Where are emerging political movements forming?"
