# 🌐 EthosMesh

**Places Definer for Next Improvement**

## 🎯 Overview

Major cities are collapsing: overcrowded, expensive, with infrastructure at breaking point. Yet everyone keeps cramming into them because that's where jobs and services are concentrated. But does it make sense to keep saturating the same places instead of unlocking the potential of thousands of other territories?

EthosMesh is a decentralized planning tool that enables local communities to collaboratively map their resources, assess the real potential of their territory, and plan sustainable development.

## 💡 The Problem

Urban and territorial development decisions are made by centralized authorities, often without genuine community involvement and with little accountability to citizens. The result is an unsustainable imbalance:

- **Suffocating metropolises**: Overcrowded, expensive, infrastructure collapsing
- **Depleted territories**: Underutilized potential, brain drain, economic stagnation
- **Top-down planning**: Decisions disconnected from actual community needs
- **Lack of alternatives**: No viable pathways to distributed development

## 🚀 The Solution

EthosMesh flips the centralized planning model by empowering citizens to actively participate in shaping their own environments through transparent democratic processes.
