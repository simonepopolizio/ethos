# 📌 EthosTask

**Milestones and Tasks Platform**

## 🎯 Overview

A streamlined platform that defines major milestones for humanity and connects with companies or associations willing to tackle them. The system organizes work into "Milestones" (major initiatives), which break down into specific "Tasks" that organizations can claim, showcase their contributions on, and complete.

## 💡 The Problem

Many crucial societal challenges remain unaddressed because:

- **Fragmented efforts**: Organizations work in isolation on overlapping problems
- **Uncoordinated action**: No shared framework for aligning initiatives
- **Invisible contributions**: Meaningful work goes unrecognized and unrewarded
- **Misaligned incentives**: Corporate resources directed toward superficial CSR rather than systemic impact

## 🚀 The Solution

EthosTask creates a transparent framework where corporate resources, expertise, and innovation capabilities can be systematically directed toward collective human progress.
