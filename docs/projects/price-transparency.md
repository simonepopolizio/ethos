# 🏷️ Price Transparency System

**Economic Accountability**

## 🎯 Overview

Prices almost always rise and rarely fall. Sometimes this is due to manipulation by entities controlling prices for their own gain. In other cases, practices like shrinkflation occur purely for profit, even when companies aren't experiencing real losses. This is unacceptable.

This project proposes a community-driven system to trace the full lifecycle of a product's pricing—from origin to final sale. By exposing where inflation is introduced and how much each step adds, we empower consumers to see behind the curtain and demand accountability.

## 💡 The Problem

Current market opacity enables systematic exploitation:

- **Hidden markups**: Consumers can't see where costs actually accumulate
- **Unjustified inflation**: Prices rise without corresponding cost increases
- **Shrinkflation**: Reduced quantity at same price, invisible to most consumers
- **Information asymmetry**: Producers know true costs, consumers remain ignorant
- **Lack of accountability**: No mechanism to challenge exploitative pricing

## 🚀 The Solution

A community-driven transparency system that traces complete product journeys from raw materials to retail, exposing every price addition along the way.

## 📱 User Journey Example

1. **Scan product** in store using mobile app
2. **View breakdown**: See raw materials (€2) → manufacturing (€1) → transport (€0.50) → wholesale markup (€3) → retail markup (€5.50) = €12 shelf price
3. **Compare**: Similar products with better value distribution
4. **Contribute**: Add pricing data from own sources
5. **Act**: Make informed purchasing decision

## 💡 Key Metrics

- **True Cost**: Actual production expenses
- **Value-Add Markup**: Justified additions (quality, service, convenience)
- **Pure Markup**: Profit margins with no corresponding value
- **Shrinkflation Index**: Quantity reduction over time
- **Ethical Rating**: Fair distribution of value through supply chain
